# `hotdrink-wasm-react`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
and is an example of how to use `hotdrink-wasm` with React.

To try the examples, you must first compile the WebAssembly code from `../hotdrink-wasm-multi-threaded` to `public/pkg`,
then start the application server. This can be done with the following commands:

```
make
yarn start
```
